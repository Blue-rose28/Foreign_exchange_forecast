# Foreign_exchange_forecast
This is Final Project 2 of Data Analytics Bootcamp, Monash University
## Project Description
### Problem
Predicting future exchange rate (AUD/USD) with Machine Learning. Constructed models include Decision Tree Regressor, LSTM (based on 100 days of Moving Average), and Linear Regression.
##File Supplied
The Resources folder contains two following cvs files:
•	The file fx.csv contains the daily exchange rate from 01/01/2021 to 07/11/2023. This file is used for the Decision Tree Regression and LSTM models.
•	The file fx_interest.csv contains the monthly exchange rate and Australian and US interest rates from 2013 to 2023.
### Deliverables
•	Create Decision Tree Regression for AUD/USD exchange rate prediction.
•	Create Decision LSTM (based on 100 days of Moving Average) for AUD/USD exchange rate prediction.
•	Create Decision LSTM (based on 100 days of Moving Average) for AUD/USD exchange rate prediction
•	Create a Dashboard to present the project results.
### Technologies
•	Jupyter Notebook
•	Pandas
•	Regular Expressions
•	Numpy
•	Seaborn
•	Panel
•	Machine Learning
### Getting Started
•	Clone this repo to your machine.
•	Run Realtime_DecisionTreeRegressor.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
•	Run 100_MovingAverage_LSTM.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
•	Run fx_interest_regression.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
•	Run Dashboard.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
•	Open your terminal with the same directory as the project, run penal serve Dashboard.ipynb to open the Dashboard.
